The full documentation for Payflow Link Legacy is [here](https://www.paypalobjects.com/webstatic/en_US/developer/docs/pdf/pp_payflowlink_guide.pdf).

Payflow sends POST requests to Return URL and Silent POST URL. Both URLs have to be set at manager.paypal.com. The Post request for Silent POST is sent after user click Submit Transaction button. And the other request is sent when user return to Payments application.
